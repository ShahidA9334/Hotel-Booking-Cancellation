# Hotel Booking Cancellations Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of hotel booking and cancellation trends from 2015 to 2017. Using Microsoft Excel, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as total bookings, cancellations, seasonal patterns, guest types, and differences between city and resort hotels.

## Objectives

- Understand cancellation trends over three years  
- Analyze the behavior of different customer segments  
- Identify high-cancellation periods and guest types  
- Compare performance between city and resort hotels  

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
- Excel Dashboarding Techniques

## Key Insights

- Total bookings analyzed: **119,390**
- Total cancellations: **44,224** (~37% cancellation rate)
- **Couples** were the most frequent customer type and had the highest cancellations
- Highest cancellations occurred during **summer months**
- **City hotels** experienced more cancellations than resort hotels

## Dashboard Highlights

The Excel dashboard includes:
- Year-wise summary of bookings and cancellations
- Guest type analysis (Couple, Family, Single)
- Monthly trends
- Room preference vs. cancellation behavior
- Comparison between City and Resort Hotels
